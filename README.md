# NeuralNetwork_R
This script demonstrates how to create a neural network in R using the "nnet" and "NeuralNetTools" libraries. The input data consist of gut microbiome compositions at the phylum level from individuals with varying stages of colorectal cancer (stages 1, 2, or 3), with the output being the corresponding cancer stage.
